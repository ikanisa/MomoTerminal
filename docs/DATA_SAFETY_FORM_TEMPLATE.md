## Section 7: Additional Context

### Short Description of Data Usage (160 characters max)
```
Collects SMS & transaction data for Mobile Money payment tracking. Data encrypted & synced to secure servers for business reporting.
```

### Detailed Explanation for Sensitive Permissions

#### SMS Permission (READ_SMS, RECEIVE_SMS)
```
MomoTerminal is a Mobile Money POS terminal that automatically detects payment confirmations from mobile money providers (MTN, Vodafone, AirtelTigo, etc.).

We ONLY read SMS from known mobile money operators to extract transaction data (amount, sender, reference). Personal SMS messages are never accessed, read, or stored.

The SMS content is parsed locally on the device using AI (with offline fallback) and immediately discarded. Only the extracted transaction data is saved for business records.

This is the core functionality of the app - without SMS access, merchants would need to manually enter every transaction, which is error-prone and time-consuming.

Alternative methods (provider APIs, manual entry) are not viable in African markets where SMS is the primary notification channel for Mobile Money transactions.
```

#### NFC Permission
```
MomoTerminal uses NFC to turn the merchant's phone into a tap-to-pay terminal. When a customer taps their NFC-enabled phone, they receive the payment details to complete the transaction on their device.

This is a core feature that enables contactless payments and improves the customer experience.
```

#### Phone Permission (CALL_PHONE)
```
Used to dial USSD codes (*170#, *110#, etc.) for manual payment initiation when NFC is not available. This allows merchants to trigger mobile money payment prompts directly from the app.
```
