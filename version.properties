# MomoTerminal Version Configuration
# This file is used for automated version management in CI/CD pipelines
#
# Version Format: MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH
# - MAJOR: Breaking changes or major feature releases
# - MINOR: New features, backwards compatible
# - PATCH: Bug fixes, backwards compatible
#
# Version Code Calculation:
# versionCode = MAJOR * 10000 + MINOR * 100 + PATCH
# Example: 1.2.3 = 10203
#
# CI/CD Usage:
# - Increment PATCH for each build
# - Increment MINOR for feature releases
# - Increment MAJOR for breaking changes
# - Use BUILD_NUMBER from CI for release builds
